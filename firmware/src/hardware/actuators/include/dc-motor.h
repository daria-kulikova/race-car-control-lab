/**
 * @brief DC motor driven by a motor driver chip.
 *
 * The DC motor which is supported by this driver is controlled with three pins:
 * - A PWM duty cycle, which is proportional to the voltage applied
 * - A phase, which changes the direction the motor is turning
 * - An enable/fault pin, which can be pulled low to disable powering the motor.
 *
 * A usual application could look like this:
 * - dcmotor_configure() to set up the motor
 * - dcmotor_enable() to enable the motor
 * - dcmotor_set_power_and_phase() to supply power and/or change the direction

 * @brief Set the amount and direction of power supplied to the motor.
 *
 * The maximum power that is delivered to the motor depends on the voltage that
 * the motor driver chip is supplied with. However, the power that is supplied
 * at a particular instant can be varied in between the maximum power and no
 * power.
 *
 * The direction of the current flow (changed through the motor phase) changes
 * the turning direction of the motor.
 *
 * Both of these can be changed by setting the @p power parameter: for values
 * larger than zero, the phase will be set to logic high, and for lower than
 * zero it will be set to logic low.
 *
 * The amount of power to be supplied to the motor is given as a percentage, so
 * the range of valid inputs to this function is [-100.0f, +100.0f].
 *
 * @note If coasting is enabled (DCMotor.auto_coasting), then specifying
 * @p power equal to zero will disable the motor. In turn, this also means that
 * if @p power is larger than zero, the motor will be enabled.
 *
 * @note Will disable motor if it's enable_coasting() is set to true.
 * @param power Percentage of power in range [-100, 100] to supply to motor.
 * @returns true if the power point could successfully be changed.
